# Overview #

Share a curated definition and educational path for Technical roles from the perspective of a practitioner working with a large number of teams doing (or trying-to do): 

* Agile
* DevOps
* Cloud
* Containers (Docker, kubernetes)
* Operate Applications at Scale with High Availability

The education paths constructed from a mix of self-paced instruction and experiences:

## Experiences ##

* delivering software
* participating as a member or leader of a team

## Curricula ##

* Training & Certification
* Talks
* Essays & Technical Papers
* Books 

# Roles #

Education Paths for the following roles are currently in a `DRAFT`, though useful state.

* [Application Platform Engineer](application-platform-engineer.md)
* [Senior Application Platform Engineer](senior-application-platform-engineer.md)
* [Software Engineer](software-engineer.md)
* [Senior Software Engineer](senior-software-engineer.md)


# Why? #

This repo exists because I am frequently asked:

> What do I need to know to be an X?

> How can I become a Y?

I want to help people advance their careers in Tech with a better than random-luck strategy.

I would like to achieve a few things with this repo:

* share my perspective as a bookmarkable & forkable resource
* incorporate feedback from colleagues who are trying to do the same

## Differences ##

This approach intends to provide a curated path to a role that is achievable by someone who is working towards a promotion from one level to another as well as transitioning from one type of role to another, e.g. individual contributor <-> manager.

This repo will not:

* provide an exhaustive list of the best papers on (nearly) every technical topic, e.g. [Papers We Love](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love)
* a fresh set of Technical papers to read each day or week, e.g. [The Morning Paper](https://blog.acolyer.org/)
